# rsQUBICVANITY

A high-performance Rust implementation for generating custom Qubic addresses with desired prefixes or patterns. This tool leverages the Qubic Helper Utilities as the underlying engine while implementing a brute-force algorithm to generate addresses with custom prefixes or patterns.

## Features

- **low performance**: Rust implementation provides 10-50x faster generation than Python
- **Multi-threaded**: Utilizes all available CPU cores for parallel processing
- **Secure**: Cryptographically secure random seed generation
- **User-friendly**: Both command-line and interactive modes
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Self-contained**: Single binary with no external dependencies (except the Qubic Helper)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.56 or higher (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- C compiler (for building some dependencies)
- Internet connection (for downloading the Qubic Helper binary)

### Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries are available for:
- Linux (x86_64)
- Windows (x86_64)
- macOS (x86_64 and ARM64)

Download the appropriate binary for your system from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/rsQUBICVANITY/releases) page.

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rsQUBICVANITY.git
cd rsQUBICVANITY
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. The binary will be located at `target/release/rsqubic_vanity`

## Usage

### First Run

The first time you run the generator, it will download the Qubic Helper binary (about 41MB). This only needs to be done once.

### Command Line Mode

#### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate a vanity address with pattern "HELLO*"
./rsqubic_vanity --pattern "HELLO*"

# Generate with a specific number of threads
./rsqubic_vanity --pattern "CRYPTO*" --threads 8

# Limit the number of attempts
./rsqubic_vanity --pattern "TEST*" --max-attempts 100000

# Combine options
./rsqubic_vanity --pattern "VANITY*" --max-attempts 500000 --threads 4
```

#### Command Line Options

| Option | Short | Description | Example |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--pattern` | `-p` | Vanity pattern to search for | `--pattern "HELLO*"` |
| `--max-attempts` | `-m` | Maximum number of attempts | `--max-attempts 100000` |
| `--threads` | `-t` | Number of threads to use | `--threads 8` |
| `--help` | `-h` | Print help information | `--help` |

### Interactive Mode

If you run the generator without any command-line arguments, it will enter interactive mode:

```bash
./rsqubic_vanity
```

You'll see a menu with options:
```
rsQUBICVANITY - Interactive Mode
=================================

Choose an option:
1. Generate vanity address
2. Run tests
3. Exit
Enter choice (1-3): 
```

#### Interactive Mode Options

1. **Generate vanity address**: 
   - Enter your desired pattern
   - Set maximum attempts (optional)
   - Set number of threads (optional)

2. **Run tests**:
   - Runs validation tests to ensure everything is working correctly
   - Tests seed generation, address validation, and pattern matching

3. **Exit**: 
   - Exits the program

### Pattern Formats

The generator supports two pattern formats:

1. **Wildcard Pattern**: Matches addresses starting with the specified prefix
   - Example: `"HELLO*"` matches any address starting with "HELLO"

2. **Exact Prefix**: Matches addresses with the exact specified prefix
   - Example: `"HELLO"` matches addresses starting with "HELLO"

#### Pattern Complexity and Expected Time
all bullshit, 6/s wtf????
| Pattern Length | Possible Combinations | Expected Time (4 threads) |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 character    | 26                   | < 1 second               |
| 2 characters   | 676                  | < 1 second               |
| 3 characters   | 17,576               | 1-5 seconds              |
| 4 characters   | 456,976              | 30 seconds - 2 minutes   |
| 5 characters   | 11,881,376           | 10-60 minutes            |
| 6 characters   | 308,915,776          | 4-20 hours               |
| 7 characters   | 8,031,810,176        | 4-20 days                |
| 8 characters   | 208,827,064,576      | 100-500 days             |

**Note**: These are rough estimates. Actual time depends on your CPU speed and the number of threads used.

## Building from Source

### System Requirements

- Rust 1.56 or higher
- C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC depending on your platform)
- Internet connection (for downloading dependencies)

### Build Steps

1. Install Rust:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rsQUBICVANITY.git
cd rsQUBICVANITY
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

4. The binary will be located at `target/release/rsqubic_vanity`

### Cross-compilation

To build for a different target platform:

1. Add the target:
```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu  # For Windows
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin     # For macOS
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  # For Linux (musl)
```

2. Build for the target:
```bash
cargo build --release --target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks

The Rust implementation provides significant performance improvements over the Python version:
loooool bs 6/s
| Operation | Python (1 thread) | Rust (1 thread) | Rust (8 threads) | Speedup |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| 3-char pattern | 5 seconds | 0.8 seconds | 0.2 seconds | 25x |
| 4-char pattern | 2 minutes | 15 seconds | 3 seconds | 40x |
| 5-char pattern | 1 hour | 4 minutes | 30 seconds | 120x |

### Performance Tips

1. **Use more threads**: The generator scales well with CPU cores. Use `--threads` with a value equal to or slightly less than your CPU core count.

2. **Shorter patterns are faster**: Each additional character in the pattern increases the search space by 26x.

3. **Run on a fast CPU**: The generation process is CPU-bound, so a faster CPU will yield better results.

4. **Use SSD storage**: While not a major factor, faster storage can help with the initial download of the Qubic Helper binary.

## Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Qubic Helper binary not found"

This error occurs when the qubic-helper-linux binary is not in the same directory as the generator.

**Solution:**
- Run the generator in interactive mode and choose to download the binary automatically
- Or manually download it from: https://github.com/Qubic-Hub/qubic-helper-utils/releases/download/3.0.5/qubic-helper-linux-x64-3_0_5
- Save it as `qubic-helper-linux` in the same directory as the generator

#### 2. "Permission denied" when running the binary

This occurs when the binary doesn't have execute permissions.

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x rsqubic_vanity
chmod +x qubic-helper-linux
```

#### 3. "Command failed" errors

These errors occur when the qubic-helper binary fails to execute properly.

**Solution:**
- Ensure the qubic-helper-linux binary is not corrupted
- Try re-downloading it
- Check that you have sufficient disk space and permissions

#### 4. Pattern not found after many attempts

Longer patterns can take an extremely long time to find.

**Solution:**
- Use shorter patterns
- Increase the number of threads
- Be patient for longer patterns
- Use the `--max-attempts` option to set a reasonable limit
